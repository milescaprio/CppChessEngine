Chess Engine, Created in C++.

-Evaluates using heuristics such as evolving piece location maps and piece values

-Searches using move tree with mini-max and alpha-beta pruning traversal algorithms

-Includes search optimizations: move-ordering, transposition tables, iterative deepening, bitmaps

-Completely functional with some bugs. If I have time I would like to return to this project in the future to polish it and add more features, including integrating the graphical interface I created, and making a stronger debug application for customizing the engine.
